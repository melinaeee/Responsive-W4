            The name says it all. We're 100% women's soccer, 100% of the time.
            In a world where women's soccer have been perennially
            underappreciated, underpromoted, and underfunded, WoSo World exists
            to shine a light on the stories, athletes and moments that define
            and fuel the women's game. This isn't a token sub-brand or at the
            bottom of some dropdown menu. We aren't doing this for charity. From
            jaw-dropping performances to off-court fits, we bring sports fans
            everything they need to see and know in the world of women's soccer.

          <h4 class="mt-5">Melina Gaspar, creator and founder</h4>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Melina is the founder and CEO of WoSo World. Frustrated by a lack of
            media coverage devoted to women's sports, Melina founded WSW in
            2022. Starting with an front end developer bootcamp at SheCodes and
            a big idea, it took Melina only a few short months to grow WSW into
            the leading media platform dedicated to women's soccer.
